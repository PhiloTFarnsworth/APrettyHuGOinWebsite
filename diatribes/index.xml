While the basic templates encourage usage for websites like blogs, I though it would be an interesting to build a template that would work like a book or manual.
See the original Pretty Heckin&amp;rsquo; Website
As a brief note, I will menton that I don't necessarily think the is the most efficient method of implementing a manual.</description></item><item><title>Why Another Jekyllin' Website</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/why/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/why/</guid><description>Learning web design? Get ready to be schooled
Modelling a website is no mean feat, and it's often useful to go back and check the html spec from time to time as it updates. This is especially important when you're going for an informative tone. This site seeks to model a text heavy informative website (like a blog) while also utilizing much of the current available HTML features.</description></item><item><title>Section Headings: A Modest Proposal</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/section/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/section/</guid><description>Headings Tip Keep them short, Wordsworth.
Headings are shamelessly abused by most modern websites. Beyond usage in an article tag, They should follow their natural ordering and group information based on their labels. They shouldn't be used for emphasis, or for rhetorical conversations with the reader, instead they should give the reader an idea of the content to follow. Not only will using relevant headers help your readers follow the content of your page, but it might stop you from abusing data related tags like the ones to follow.</description></item><item><title>Data Organization</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/data/</guid><description> Styling These elements are also ideal places to add some color.
While you can deliver text in easy to digest chunks, HTML provides several tags that can provide comparisons, lists and other information. Not only can you provide this information in a uniform matter, you can do so without adding extra accessibility overhead.</description></item><item><title>Tables</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/tables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/tables/</guid><description>For instance, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to measure this website against some other well respected peers? A table can provide that information at a glance. Well respected peers in this case includes several profanity laced tirades about minimalist website design that for better or worse inspired this project. Peruse at your own discretion.

While this can be convenient in cutting down paragraphs into more digestable content, they should be used judiciously. As a general rule of thumb, lists over five items should either be refactored into nested lists, or refactored into separate lists.
Numbered Lists What? Are you writing a table of contents
For example, the many features of A Pretty Heckin' Website might become unwieldy if we placed them in a single line, but by nesting lists the user can more efficiently skim the information provided.</description></item><item><title>Other Informational Widgets</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/other/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/other/</guid><description>Internet Explorer It still exists.
These next few widgets have a special significance in that they are not supported in Internet Explorer. IE compatibility isn't as big a concern as it was in the past, but you never know, so keep compatibility in mind and don't lock any core functionality behind these features. Details The details1 tag is a handy way to implement footnotes and other non-critical data that doesn&amp;rsquo;t merit an aside bubble.</description></item><item><title>Forms are Fundamental</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/form/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/form/</guid><description>Form Warning! You could make pseudo form elements with Javascript. Resist the temptation.
It's hard to think of a website that doesn't contain form. Even if your content is a canon of theological theses, you're at least going to want to get users to subscribe to your newsletter. Most important considerations are to keep it simple, even if you're running frameworks on top of frameworks, your forms are going to boil down to something like the one below.</description></item><item><title>Media, images and other pretty things</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/media/</guid><description>I didn't kill my wife! Also something about web design! Dr. Richard Kimble , Seeking the One Armed Man (1963) Media is also another concern in modern design. Videos should be responsively sized for both desktop and mobile. Size and compression is a consideration. We can also embed, if we are concerned with hosting video.
A lot of the same advice goes for images, with an added emphasis on size.</description></item><item><title>Pretty Heckin' Website is not a satire</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/satire/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/satire/</guid><description>Every website should look like this, and any which do not conform should be removed from the internet with extreme prejudice. But on a more serious note, minding these standard HTML patterns can help make your webpages more accessible and functional. This site can also be used to measure CSS designs with by modifying the div and div#flexRows to be assigned to create columns and rows respectively. Since you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen it in the superior form, you can compare and see where the prospective layout may falter.</description></item><item><title>Epilogue</title><link>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/epilogue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHuGoinWebsite/diatribes/epilogue/</guid><description>Inspired by the brilliant pages The Best M&amp;amp;!@#F$%^&amp;amp;@!
