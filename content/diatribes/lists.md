Whereas tables are ideal for comparisons, lists are good for condensing repetitive or related data. While this can be convenient in cutting down paragraphs into more digestable content, they should be used judiciously. As a general rule of thumb, lists over five items should either be refactored into nested or separate lists unless there's a significantly compelling reason.

{{< col >}}
    {{< aside head="Numbered Lists" body="What? Are you writing a table of contents?" >}}
    {{</ aside >}}
    <p>
        For example, the many features of A Pretty Heckin' Website might become unwieldy if we placed them in a single line, but by nesting lists the user can more efficiently skim the information provided. Nesting should be styled with increasingly shrinking fronts to remind the writer that information nested too deeply might as well be inaccessible. Much like headings, keep these items short and leave your sentences in paragraphs.
