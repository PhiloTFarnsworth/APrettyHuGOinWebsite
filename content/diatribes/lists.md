        Whereas tables are ideal for comparisons, lists are good condensing repetitive or related data. While
        this
        can be convenient in cutting down paragraphs into more digestable content, they should be used
        judiciously. As a general rule of thumb, lists over five items should either be refactored into nested
        lists, or refactored into separate lists.

For example, the many features of A Pretty Heckin' Website might become unwieldy if we placed them in a
single line, but by nesting lists the user can more efficiently skim the information provided. Nesting
should be styled with increasingly shrinking fronts to remind the writer to that deeply nested information
might as well be inaccessible. Much like headings, keep these items short and leave your sentences in
paragraphs.
