Whereas tables are ideal for comparisons, lists are good condensing repetitive or related data. While this
can be convenient in cutting down paragraphs into more digestable content, they should be used
judiciously. As a general rule of thumb, lists over five items should either be refactored into nested
lists, or refactored into separate lists.

{{< col >}}
    {{< aside head="Numbered Lists" body="What? Are you writing a table of contents" >}}
    {{</ aside >}}
    <p>
        For example, the many features of A Pretty Heckin' Website might become unwieldy if we placed them in a
        single line, but by nesting lists the user can more efficiently skim the information provided. Nesting
        should be styled with increasingly shrinking fronts to remind the writer to that deeply nested information
        might as well be inaccessible. Much like headings, keep these items short and leave your sentences in
        paragraphs.
