Text is undoubtedly the cornerstone of web content distribution, but too much text can degrade the readability of your content.  Furthermore, through print media we can see that often a list, table or graphic can convey dense amounts of information in much more palatable forms than raw text. 

{{< col >}}

    {{< aside head="Styling" body="These elements are also ideal places to add some color." >}}
    {{</ aside >}}
    <p>
        Luckily, {{< abbr HTML >}} provides several tags that can provide comparisons, lists and other information. Not only can you provide this information in a uniform matter, you can do so without adding a ton of extra accessibility overhead.

{{</ col >}}

This exploration will mostly look at common HTML elements, though we will also check out some of the relatively newer kids on the block (No, not Donnie Wahlberg) like progress bars and meters.
