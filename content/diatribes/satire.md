Every website should look like this and any which do not conform should be removed from the internet with extreme prejudice.

With considerate usage of {{< abbr CSS >}} and conservative usage of Vanilla {{< abbr JS >}}, you can also serve that data with minimal overhead.  Finally, by utilizing a static site framework like Hugo, you can create durable templates for your content and serve it in diverse forms, spending less time coding and more time creating.
