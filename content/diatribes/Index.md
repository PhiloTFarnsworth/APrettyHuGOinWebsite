A Pretty HuGOin' website is a proving ground for some basic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework customization for use with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).  While the basic templates encourage usage for websites like blogs, I though it would be an interesting project to build a template that would work like a manual.

See the original [A Pretty Heckin' Website](https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHeckinWebsite/) and the intermediate version [A Pretty Jekyllin' Website](https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyJekyllinWebsite/).

    <p>
        One of the advantages of a static site generator is that it makes it relatively simple to create both a static website, for users who don't want to use Javascript, as well as an SPA homepage from the same source content.  Beyond that, we can decouple the work of creating content from the work of rendering that content in an accessible and semantic manner.
