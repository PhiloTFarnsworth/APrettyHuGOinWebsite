A Pretty HuGOin' website is a proving ground for some basic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework customization for use with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).  While the basic templates encourage usage for websites like blogs, I though it would be an interesting to build a template that would work like a book or manual.  

See the original [Pretty Heckin' Website](https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHeckinWebsite/)

        As a brief note, I will menton that I don't necessarily think the is the most efficient method of implementing a manual.  I feel it could be more beneficial to just fetch the sections using javascript and then render them within a single document.  This would avoid users having to re-acquire resources, which unfortunately due to the base settings of Github Pages, we cannot use cache control headers to mitigate.  That being said, the conveniences offered by Jekyll, such as easily building pages using mostly markdown instead of HTML, do make this method viable for building such a site.
