Headings are shamelessly abused by many modern websites. Beyond usage in an article tag, They should follow their natural ordering and group information based on their content. They shouldn't be used for emphasis, or for rhetorical conversations with the reader, instead they should give the reader an idea of the content to follow.

{{< col >}}
    
    <p>
        Not only do headings provide a visual landmark for content, they also provide landmarks for screen readers.  Avoiding overly long or otherwise irrelevant headings can help ensure that all users can review your content.
