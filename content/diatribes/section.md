        Headings are shamelessly abused by many modern websites. Beyond usage in an article tag,
        They should follow their natural ordering and group information based on their labels. They shouldn't be
        used for emphasis, or for rhetorical conversations with the reader, instead they should give the reader
        an idea of the content to follow.

Not only will using relevant headers help your readers follow the content of your page,
but it might stop you from abusing data related tags like the ones to follow.
