This site seeks to model a text heavy informative website (like a manual or textbook) while also utilizing many of the current available {{< abbr abbr="HTML" title="HyperText Markup Language" >}} elements. We'll also create a small but sensible set of styling instructions in {{< abbr abbr="CSS" title="Cascading Style Sheets" >}} and a couple of handy but optional {{< abbr title="Javascript" abbr="JS" >}} features.

    {{< aside head="Learning web design?" body="Get ready to be schooled!" >}}
        {{< image image="dunce" alt="Armored man dons a pointy dunce cap." >}}
    {{</ aside >}}
    <p>
         By doing so across both Single Page Application ({{< abbr SPA >}}) and static experiences, we ensure our content is accessible, both to users who may have conditions that impair their ability to browse a website, as well as to users who have a revulsion to running Javascript.
