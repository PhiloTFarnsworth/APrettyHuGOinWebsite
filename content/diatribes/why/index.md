        Modelling a website is no mean feat, and it's often useful to go back and check the html spec
        from time to time as it updates. This is especially important when you're going for an informative tone.
        This site seeks to model a text heavy informative website (like a blog) while also utilizing much of the
        current available {{< abbr abbr="HTML" title="HyperText Markup Language" >}} features. We'll also create a
        small but sensible set of styling instructions in {{< abbr abbr="CSS" title="Cascading Style Sheets" >}} and a couple
        of handy but optional {{< abbr title="Javascript" abbr="JS" >}} features.

<!-- Still relying on our div to make columns and preserve aside spacing.  I want to keep the aside functionality as is but something to think about. -->
